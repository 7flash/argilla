    "Language models, despite their ability to perform various natural language processing tasks, often reflect biases and ethical concerns. These biases include a range of categories such as age, gender, race, ethnicity and others ([Huang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14345.pdf)), and extend to issues such as misinformation, toxicity and hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root of these concerns lies in the fact that language models are trained on large datasets that replicate real-world characteristics, inadvertently perpetuating these biases and creating false associations. This leads to both technical and ethical problems, including the risk of reinforcing societal prejudices against marginalised groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these biases requires intervention that can be at different stages of model training and output generation, as suggested by several studies ([(Yeh et al., 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.rocling-1.37.pdf), [(Liang et al., 2021)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/liang21a/liang21a.pdf), [(Garimella et al., 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.397.pdf)). As retraining a language model is not efficient, a notable strategy is the incorporation of human feedback. In this method, the model's responses are evaluated by human raters, and the feedback is used to develop a reward model. This reward model, in turn, guides a reinforcement learning process to adjust the parameters of the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of this approach is to make the outputs of the language model more closely match human norms and values. In this way, bias is reduced, robustness is increased, and the model's outputs are more ethically aligned and socially responsible, minimizing their potential negative impact on society."
